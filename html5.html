          Christmas is an annual festival, commemorating the birth of Jesus
          Christ,observed primarily on December as a religious and cultural
          celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central
          to the Christian liturgical year, it is preceded by the season of
          Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide,
          which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on
          Twelfth Night;in some traditions, Christmastide includes an octave.
          Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations,is
          celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as
          culturally by many non-Christians,and forms an integral part of the
          holiday season centered around it.

          The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated
          in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in
          accordance with messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in
          the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where
          the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to
          shepherds who then further disseminated the information.
